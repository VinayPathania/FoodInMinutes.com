# FoodInMinutes.com
FoodInMinutes is basically a delivery application. This application has two users one is customer and the other is restaurant. I have created the APIs for both customer and restaurant section.
## Problem Statement:
- The Aim of this application is to form a bridge between restaurant and customers.
- The Restaurant owners must be able to sign in to the application to create and list out their food items along with the price 
- So, that the customers could sign up , view the nearby restaurants and place the order.
- The customer selects the method of payment and makes a payment for his order.
- The restaurant owner can accept his order and delivery the order to customer
